# GitHub Actions maintenance notes

## Ancestry-only pull requests

A pull request that changes Git ancestry while preserving the target tree byte-for-byte can have a zero-file diff. GitHub path filters then may not schedule a required workflow even though branch protection still expects its status context.

For an ancestry-only PR targeting a protected branch, run the required workflow manually with `workflow_dispatch` on the PR head when GitHub reports a required context as `expected`. Do not add unrelated product changes or weaken the required status check merely to make the PR mergeable.

## Playwright retry semantics

CI may retain Playwright retries for traces, diagnostics, and classification, but a retry must never convert a failed test attempt into a green release gate. The shared root Playwright configuration must fail on flaky tests in CI: first-attempt pass is green, fail-then-pass is red, and exhausted retries are red.

`test/ci/verify-playwright-gate.mjs` exercises those three exit-code cases through the shared configuration without launching a browser. Keep that contract proof in the Packaged Smoke path when changing shared Playwright gate semantics. Merge enforcement of packaged browser status contexts is a separate GitHub ruleset responsibility tracked by #227.
